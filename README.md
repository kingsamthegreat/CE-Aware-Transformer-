# CE-Aware Transformer

Prototype implementation of a Transformer informed by the Consciousness Equation (CE = I × A × Θ).

## Overview
The CE-Aware Transformer integrates observer-field tensors with standard attention mechanisms. 
It is designed to simulate and compare CE dynamics with Integrated Information Theory (IIT) 
across neural and AI systems.

## Goals
- Provide reproducible simulation code
- Demonstrate CE-informed architectures
- Enable collaboration and feedback

## Quick Start
1. Clone this repo
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run demo: `jupyter notebook notebooks/demo.ipynb`
